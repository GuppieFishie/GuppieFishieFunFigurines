If you have a problem with any of these terms, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying for your commissioned piece.
<br><br>

<b>general</b><br><br>
- I might record the making process and post it on my youtube.
<br><br>
- Prices are subject to change based on demand.
<br><br>
- I have the right to reject any order that I do not feel comfortable making for any reason.
<br><br>


<b>process</b><br><br>
- I will notify you when I have started on your commission and you, therefore, lose the rights to a refund.
<br><br>
- During the process, I will utilize progress pictures to make revisions with you, so the figurine is just how you like!
<br><br>
- The time it takes to finish can vary, 2 days - 2 months depending on health, complexity of commission, other work, and more.
<br><br>
- If anything that may dely the process of sculpting/sending you the figurine happens, I will let you know asap.
<br><br>
- Once I finish, I will send you the package containing the completed figurine.
<br><br>


<b>revisions</b><br><br>
- If you wish for me to make a change you already approved, an additional fee is added based on my hourly wage.
<br><br>



<b>copyright & usage</b><br><br>
with the pictures of the finished figurine, I am allowed to:<br><br>
- Promote myself with it everywhere
<br><br>
- Display it everywhere to my liking (website, social media, etc.)
<br><br>
- Post it wherever I want
<br><br><br>
the buyer is allowed to:<br><br>
- Use the figurine for personal use (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)
<br><br>
- claim the character as your own, but not the artwork itself. (unless you do not own the character :P)
<br><br>
- Use the artwork to promote yourself. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated.
<br><br>
- Use the artwork on your Youtube channel/in monetized videos if artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings.
<br><br>



<b>These are a copyright infringement:</b><br><br>
- Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially (making money off it)
<br><br>
- Claiming the artwork as your own
<br><br>




<b>customer happiness:</b><br><br>
- I will do everything I can to make my customers happy! :D
<br><br>
- If you have a problem with anything, please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.
<br><br>
- I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission.<br><br> (ex: if you don't want me to post the sculpture online)
<br><br>


<b>What if my figurine arrives damaged?</b><br><br>
The last thing I would want is for your figurine to be damaged in the mail,
<br><br>
so I take extra care to package it safely. However, it it manages to break despite
<br><br>
my efforts, you have these options:
<br><br>
You may have a full refund (including return shipping) if you are willing 
<br><br>
to send it back to me. Then, I can fix the figurine and relist it. :D
<br><br><br>
Or, if you are happy to fix the figurine by yourself with what you have,
<br><br>
I can assist you over email, and will give you a discount code for the future. :D
<br><br>




<b>refund/cancellation/returns:</b><br><br>
- The buyer is not allowed a refund once I started working on the commission.
<br><br>
- If for any reason I am unable to start your commission you will receive a full refund.
<br><br>
- If you cancel your order before I started it, you can get a full refund.
<br><br>
- Returns are not allowed for custom figurines since they are made just for you
<br><br>
(unless the figurine arrives and was broken during shipping, then see the section above).
<br><br>
- If you are getting a refund, do not request a Paypal chargeback. I will transfer the money back to you myself.
<br><br>
-If you request a Paypal chargeback at any point when you were not allowed to ask for a refund you will lose all <br><br>beforementioned rights to the commissioned piece and I will have the full right to profit further from it in any<br><br> way. I will decline the chargeback and supply Paypal with our conversations in which we talk about the <br><br>commission as evidence that I have completed work for you. Furthermore, you will be blacklisted for <br><br>commissioning me again.<br><br><br><br>



If the buyer breaks any of the points stated above they will lose all the beforementioned rights to the artwork <br><br>commissioned by me, and I will have the right to profit further from the commissioned<br><br> artwork in any way I see fit. If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be <br><br>changed if discussed with me prior to paying your commissioned piece.<br><br>
